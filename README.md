In this compiler we enter a code and run it to train a mudule in Arduino UNO



3. System Architecture:
The Bluetooth module is connected to the Arduino, and the relay is connected to the output pins of the Arduino. The lights are connected to the relay. The Arduino is powered by the 5-volt battery. The Android app communicates with the Bluetooth module to send ON/OFF commands.

4. Working Principle:
The Android app sends ON/OFF commands to the Arduino via Bluetooth.
The Arduino processes the received commands and controls the relay accordingly.
The relay switches the lights ON or OFF based on the Arduino's command.
5. Implementation Steps:
a. Connect the Bluetooth module to the Arduino following the datasheet. b. Connect the relay to the Arduino output pins. c. Connect the lights to the relay. d. Power the Arduino using the 5-volt battery. e. Develop a simple Android app with Bluetooth capabilities. f. Pair the Android app with the Bluetooth module. g. Implement code on the Arduino to process Bluetooth commands and control the relay.



Arduino Coding:-
char val;
void setup() {
pinMode(13,OUTPUT);
Serial.begin(9600);
 digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
  
}
void loop() {
  if(Serial.available()){
 val = Serial.read();
 Serial.println(val);
}
if(val=='1'){
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
}
else if(val=='2'){
  digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
}
delay(100);
}
